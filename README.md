# Robo Edits


- Added G35 command. Auto adjust Probe Offset(M851 Z) for ambient light levels based on the trigger distance of the IR probe(Requires Home Offset Z(M206 Z) to be set)
- Added G36 command. G36 will home, run G35, then run G29
- Added Robo Configuration Variable. in Configuration.h you now only need to change ROBO_BOARD_VERSION to change the configuration for C2/R2/R2_Dual

# PlatformIO

### Robo's Version of marlin has an automated building feature (Adapted from vanilla Marlin)
Robo has extended the platformio integration put in place by the marlin team. When building with platformio a `Marlin_Build` directory will be made, in this directory the build for R2, C2, and R2 dual can be found. 

More information can be found at: http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/what-is-platformio.html

## How to use platformio

### CLI tools

- Install the platformio CLI tools using pip
```
pip install -U platformio
```
- navigate to your Marlin directory
```
cd Marlin
```
- run platformio
```
platformio run
```

More detailed instructions can be found at: http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/installation.html

### Atom

- Install PlatformIO for Atom
http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/atom.html#ide-atom

- Open the Marlin repository in Atom

- Click on PlatformIO >> build to process the project
http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/atom.html#process-project

## How to configure platformio

### Build targets
By default we only have the R2 environment targeted in the `platformio.ini` file. To target all environments alter the `platformio.ini` file and look for a line that says:
```
env_default = R2
```

Comment out that line to build all targets (C2/R2/R2_Dual). Or target a specific environment.

## Submitting Patches
Proposed patches should be submitted as a Pull Request against the [RCBugFix](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RCBugFix) branch.

- Don't submit new feature proposals. The RCBugFix branch is for fixing bugs in existing features.
- Do submit questions and concerns. The "naive" question is often the one we forget to ask.
- Follow the proper coding style. Pull requests with styling errors will be delayed. See our [Coding Standards](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/wiki/DNE-Coding-Standards) page for more information.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.

# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware
<img align="right" src="../../raw/1.1.x/buildroot/share/pixmaps/logo/marlin-250.png" />

## Marlin 1.1

Marlin 1.1 represents an evolutionary leap over Marlin 1.0.2. It is the result of over two years of effort by several volunteers around the world who have paid meticulous and sometimes obsessive attention to every detail. For this release we focused on code quality, performance, stability, and overall user experience. Several new features have also been added, many of which require no extra hardware.

For complete Marlin documentation click over to the [Marlin Homepage <marlinfw.org>](http://marlinfw.org/), where you will find in-depth articles, how-to videos, and tutorials on every aspect of Marlin, as the site develops. For release notes, see the [Releases](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases) page.

## Stable Release Branch

This Release branch contains the latest tagged version of Marlin (currently 1.1.6 – October 2017).

Previous releases of Marlin include [1.0.2-2](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/1.0.2-2) (December 2016) and [1.0.1](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/1.0.1) (December 2014). Any version of Marlin prior to 1.0.1 (when we started tagging versions) can be collectively referred to as Marlin 1.0.0.

## Contributing to Marlin

Click on the [Issue Queue](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/pulls) links above at any time to see what we're currently working on.

To submit patches and new features for Marlin 1.1 check out the [bugfix-1.1.x](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-1.1.x) branch, add your commits, and submit a Pull Request back to the `bugfix-1.1.x` branch. Periodically that branch will form the basis for the next minor release.

Note that our "bugfix" branch will always contain the latest patches to the current release version. These patches may not be widely tested. As always, when using "nightly" builds of Marlin, proceed with full caution.

## Current Status: In Development

Marlin development has reached an important milestone with its first stable release in over 2 years. During this period we focused on cleaning up the code and making it more modern, consistent, readable, and sensible.

## Future Development

Marlin 1.1 is the last "flat" version of Marlin!

Arduino IDE now has support for folder hierarchies, so Marlin 1.2 will have a [hierarchical file structure](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/breakup-marlin-idea). Marlin's newly reorganized code will be easier to work with and form a stronger starting-point as we get into [32-bit CPU support](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/32-Bit-RCBugFix-new) and the Hardware Access Layer (HAL).
